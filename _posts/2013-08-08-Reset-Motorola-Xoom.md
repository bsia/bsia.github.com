My coleague somehow locked himself out of his Motorola Xoom while he was on airplane mode
(no wifi).  There''s no other way around that than to do a hard reset.

The key is to push the volume down button exactly 3 seconds after you see
the Motorola logo during bootup.  It''s a small window, but you just have to pay close
attention.
