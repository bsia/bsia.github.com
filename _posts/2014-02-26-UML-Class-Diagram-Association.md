[Here](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/rational/library/content/RationalEdge/sep04/bell/) is a good overview of UML Class Diagrams.
[And here](http://aviadezra.blogspot.com/2009/05/uml-association-aggregation-composition.html) is a
good description of how to apply various associations between classes.

But what about if a class just uses another class as a method parameter?
According to [this SO entry](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15587667/uml-when-one-class-have-as-method-parameter-pointer-to-other-class),
it is better to use the dashed arrow, instead of an _association_.
