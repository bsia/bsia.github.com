There are a few git workflows out there.  Two that have caught my eye are the ff:

 * [github-style](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html)
 * [Git-Flow style](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

I'm leaning towards the former...

Note as for bug/issue/PBI tracking, one tool which seems popular is Redmine.
