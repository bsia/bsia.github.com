Confirmation from Google regarding not to use the "multiprocess" attribute that can be specified
in a number of Android components (Activity, Service, etc...)

["Don't use this, it is some old cruft from pre-1.0 design that doesn't work and
should be ignored these days.  Just pretend like the attribute doesn't exist. :}"](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-developers/u9UMJtALSXw)
